Customers who place orders have increased from 2017 to 2018, as with active customers. However, it is different with customers who place orders again, which actually decreased from 2017 to 2018. Companies can evaluate the results of reviews of products sold to maintain sales quality and influence customers to reorder. So, it is hoped that in the following year, customer reorders will increase.

Company data from 2017 to 2018 has been observed to experience increasing revenue movements. However, on the other side, it was found that the number of canceled orders also increased every year. Companies need to evaluate what are the biggest obstacles that cause customers to cancel orders, this can be known by providing reasons for canceling in the available column before each canceling order. From this insight, companies can reduce the number of canceled orders each year so that revenue from the company increases.
